# ClassifyGPT

## Description
ClassifyGPT is a product classifier based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model to classify products into their category hierarchy path as specified in the [Icecat feed](https://icecat.biz/).  
This project combines the findings of [Self-Consistency]( 	
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.11171) (Wang et al., 2022) and [Choice Shuffling Ensemble]( 	
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.16452) (Nori et al., 2023) for Multiple-Choice Chain of Thought Reasoning and applies the resulting prompt to product classification.

## Installation and usage
To run ClassifyGPT, you need to set your OpenAI API key in your system's environment variables: OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
